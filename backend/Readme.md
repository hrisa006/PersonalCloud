# Personal Cloud Backend (Express + TypeScript + PostgreSQL + Docker)

This is the backend service for the Personal Cloud project, built with:

- Node.js + Express (TypeScript)
- PostgreSQL (as a Docker service)
- Docker + Docker Compose (for local development)

---

## Requirements

- Docker: https://www.docker.com/
- Docker Compose: https://docs.docker.com/compose/
- Optional: Node.js (https://nodejs.org/) if you want to run locally without Docker

---

## Step-by-Step: Build and Run

1. Install dependencies (if running locally)

   npm install

2. Build Docker image manually (optional)

   docker build -t personal-cloud-backend .

3. Run PostgreSQL + Backend via Docker Compose

   docker-compose up --build

This will:
- Build and run the backend container on port 8081
- Start a PostgreSQL database container on port 5432
- Set up environment variables for DB connection

Access your API at: http://localhost:8081
